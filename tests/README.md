# Generative Proteomics Tests

In this directory, you can find the tests for the GenerativeProteomics model.

## Tests 

- `test_imputation_with_reference`: test to infer the imputation process with a reference dataset
- `test_imputate_no_reference`: test to infer the imputation process with a reference dataset
- `test_hyper`: tests if the model is correctly reading and updating the parameters used for imputation
- `test_hint_generation`: test to infer the process of generating the hint matrix
- `test_generate_reference`: test to infer the production of a synthetic reference dataset

## Test Goals

These tests were developed to ensure the proper functioning of the model.

They are particularly useful when you change a piece of code and you want to determine if the model is still showcasing the proper behaviour.

## How they work 

Tests use PRIDE datasets with reproducible random seeds in order to ensure consistent results:

1. Create a unittest class where the tests will take place
2. Execute the task that is being tested
3. Compare the output with previously saved results

## Commands

To run a specific test, use: 
```bash 
python -m unittest <name_of_test>
```

If you want to run all tests at once, use:
```bash 
python -m unittest discover
```

Additionally, if you want to check the coverage of the tests too, you can use the `coverage` package.

First, you install it with:
```bash 
pip install converage
```

Then, to use it on a specific test, run the following command:

```bash 
coverage run -m unittest <name_of_test>
```
If you want to run them all, run the following:
```bash 
coverage run -m unittest discover
```

After running the tests, to check the coverage run the dollowing command:
```bash 
coverage report
```

For a more detailed insight, use this command, which will create and html file that you can open in your browser:
```bash
coverage html
```

## Expected Output 

If, after running a test or a set of tests appears **OK** on the terminal, it is because they were successfully executed.

Otherwise, if it appears **FAIL**, it is because the tests have failed and there is something wrong.

When a test fails, additional information about the bug is also printed in the terminal, in order to give you some extra insight on what is wrong.

You can also use the verbose flag, which will give you more information about the tests that were ran.

To do so, you just need to run the following command:

```bash 
python -m unittest -v <name_of_test>
```
